- configurationproperties do not work ?

- springfox is not compatible with webflux, so no reactive for now

- for illegalArgExceptions build constraint violations, see
    - bootstrap-rest-api for ConstraintViolationDto
    - com.ninecookies.services.bootstrap.rest.exception.mapping.ValidationExceptionMapper

- rest models are not immutable, they use var instead of val. reason is orika. with "val", orika does not know how to
construct a model, as there is only a all-args-constructor. a custom factory could be registered with orika, but then
the mapping would be implemented completely by hand, actually, and orika would be superfluous.
    - so mapped manually for now to be able to use "val"

- look through the java-"border" and understand better, how to handle the possibly nullable return-values by java?
    - just use !! or handle them explicitly?

- use real spring security instead of token filter with thread-local

- let the CRS java tests run against the kotlin crs with spring-boot-maven-plugin

- a integration test, which does NOT start the application by itself, but just executes the tests against a already started service

- static code analysis with PMD, checkstyle and findbugs for kotlin?

- check nullability of attributes of delivery and nested objects. sometimes in tests, some attribute is just set to "null",
which may not be the case in production, e.g. delivery.orderitem.remoteCode
